PROBLEM STATEMENT : To design an automated lighting system that provide a way to conserve electrical energy of project area.

DESCRIPTION :
        Energy is crucial  in our daily life .It is impossible to imagine world without energy. Factories, educational institution, Decoration and many more are the areas where maximum energy is used .Small changes like switching light on when necessary and switching light off when it is not in use will save large amount energy.
	
A Smart Energy Conservation System that will help various organizations to play an effective role in saving electrical energy.  The major area which consumes maximum amount of electricity is observed to be the educational institutions. They are used nearly 70% of the time by students and faculties. A simple action of switching OFF the electric consumables when not in use will save lot of energy. In order to conserve energy, automated lighting system using Raspberry Pi that monitors the electrical lighting is proposed. The experimental results show that we can reduce our bill to the extent of 50% if the electrical appliances are switched OFF promptly when not in use.  The proposed method is predicted to show promising results.
