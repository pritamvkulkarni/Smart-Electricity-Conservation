<h2> Smart-Electricity-Conservation-System </h2>

<h4>**Author: Pritam Kulkarni ** </h4>

**PROBLEM STATEMENT** : To design an automated lighting system that provide a way to conserve electrical energy of project area.

**DESCRIPTION** :
 <p> Energy is crucial  in our daily life .It is impossible to imagine world without energy. From household appliances to large Factories, institutions consume energy in huge measures. Small changes like switching it on when necessary and switching off when it is not in use can save electricity in noticible amount.</p>
	
<p> A Smart Energy Conservation System will help various organizations to play an effective role in saving electrical energy. A need for such a system is typically observed in educational institutions. They are used nearly 70% of the time by students and faculties. A simple action of switching OFF the electric consumables when not in use will save lot of energy. In order to conserve energy, automated lighting system using <b>Raspberry Pi</b> that monitors the electrical lighting is proposed. The experimental results show that we can reduce our electricity bill to the extent of 50% if the electrical appliances are switched OFF promptly when not in use.  The proposed method is predicted to show promising results.</p>
